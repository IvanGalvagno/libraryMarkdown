# libraryMarkdown
It has as main goal read markdown files and validate all Link in it.

Simple CLI markdown link validator, on prompt you type 
`node .\cli.js <file.md_path>` and return if the file contains links and if does all of them are validated.

You can try it out, I let two files for testing one with links and the other without them. So, to execute you have to open the command prompt and type
`node .\cli.js .\arquivos\text1.md`
